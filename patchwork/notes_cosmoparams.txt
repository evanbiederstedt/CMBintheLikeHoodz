RE: Cosmological parameter space vs. power spectrum C_l space
We use the power spectrum because (http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9808264v2.pdf)

Although it is possible to produce constraints
on cosmological parameters directly from the data,
using the power spectrum as an intermediate step (e.g. Tegmark (1997)) has several advantages.
The near-degeneracy of some combinations of cosmological
parameters (e.g., Bond, Efstathiou &
Tegmark (1997)) implies the surfaces of constant
likelihood in cosmological parameter space are
1
highly elongated, making it difficult for search
algorithms to navigate (Oh, Spergel & Hinshaw
1998). The power spectrum space is much simpler
than the cosmological parameter space since each
multipole moment (or band of multipole moments)
is usually only weakly dependent on the others, alleviating
the search difficulties. Although one still
has the problem left of estimating nearly degenerate
cosmological parameters from the resulting
power spectrum constraints, the likelihood given
the power spectrum constraints is much easier to
compute than the likelihood given the map data.
